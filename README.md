# Personal-Pizzeria

This project is inspired by the final project of my first semester of school. To keep it brief, we had to work in groups to make a website that acts as an online pizza ordering server, similar to a Dominos clone.

In order to run the project, venv and Flask will need to be installed by following these steps:
1. Open the file (f.e. in Visual Studio Code)
2. Open a terminal and enter the following commands:
    - py -3 -m venv venv (Create virtual environment)
    - venv\Scripts\activate (Activate virtual environment)
    - pip install Flask (Install Flask which will be used to run the server)
3. Now, to run the server, make sure the virtual environment is activated, and then enter the following command in the terminal `flask run`
4. Lastly, follow the url found in the terminal (localhost)
