# Personal-Pizzeria

This project is inspired by the final project of my first semester of school. To keep it brief, we had to work in groups to make a website that acts as an online pizza ordering server, similar to a Dominos clone.

---

In order to run the project, venv and Flask will need to be installed by following these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:Cavalier1204/Personal-Pizzeria.git`
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Personal-Pizzeria`
1. Create a virtual environment and install Flask. For this follow the installation instructions according to the [Flask website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#virtual-environments).
1. Now, to run the server, make sure the virtual environment is activated, and then enter the following command in the terminal `flask run`
1. Lastly, follow the url found in the terminal (localhost)
